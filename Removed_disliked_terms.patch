Each embodies some aspect of the natural world, bound in a form which is a crude mimicry of a human or large animal. A river primordial is a mass of rock, gravel, and flowing water. A forest primordial is comprised of wood, earth, rocks, and plants. A mountain primordial is a lumbering being of glacier stone and ice. A fire primordial, depending on its mood, might take form as embers, ash and smoke—or as a raging pyre.</p>\n<p>They range in size from the height of an Ironlander to half-again as tall as a giant. Rumors persist of primordials who dwell in the deepest parts of the Wilds, or high in the ranges of the Veiled Mountains, who are as tall as an ancient tree. Beyond, some suggest, in the Shattered Wastes, live primordials who tower into the clouds. Is the sound of distant thunder sometimes the footfalls of mountain-sized primordials who dwell beyond the edges of the known world?</p>\n<p>Primordials are solitary beings and as unpredictable as the natural forces they personify. They might ignore you. They might lurk at a distance, as if observing you. Or, they might attack. They do not speak in any language we can understand. Some suggest they have no intelligence, and are merely a manifestation of the natural world, no different than a winter storm.</p>\n<p>How do you kill an primordial? Most scoff at the idea. You are just as likely to kill the rain or the sea. A mystic might tell you to use a weapon imbued with elemental power. Don’t trust them. If you see a primordial, keep your distance.

 {"_id":"9e9c1587cf1c98e1","name":"Name Template","img":"icons/dice/d10black.svg","description":"To generate a faction name, first roll or choose the name template. Then, follow the structure of the template to build the name from individual tables. If you’ve already set the faction type, picking from the tables (instead of rolling) will likely provide a more appropriate result. For example, “Silver Jackals” is a fitting name for a criminal organization. The “Empire of the Undying Suns” is a less apt name for that gang—unless their leader is prone to delusions of grandeur. In short, choosing a name will give you more control. Rolling might give you a result that doesn’t square with known aspects, but those contradictions may prove inspiring.\n\nAn alternative approach to generating a faction from scratch is to start with a random name. Then, consider what the name evokes and choose an appropriate faction type instead of rolling on those tables. For example, “Bloody Ravens” might suggest a mercenary guild, while the “Republic of the Radiant Servants” brings to mind a dominion built upon a religion, or one that idolizes a prophesied leader. If a result doesn’t inspire anything interesting, roll again or pick.","results":[{"_id":"2a50c87de7ef3c2e","range":[1,40],"text":"<a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Legacy\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> Legacy</a> <a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Affiliation\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> ⏵Affiliation</a>","type":0,"drawn":false,"flags":{}},{"_id":"9711f8e081f9fa64","range":[41,55],"text":"<a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Legacy\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> Legacy</a> <a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Identity\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> ⏵Identity</a>","type":0,"drawn":false,"flags":{}},{"_id":"95e82b3daacdb36a","range":[56,70],"text":"<a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Identity\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> Identity</a> *of the* <a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Legacy\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> ⏵Legacy</a> <a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Affiliation\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> ⏵Affiliation</a>","type":0,"drawn":false,"flags":{}},{"_id":"ee3eaa0c926249ad","range":[71,100],"text":"<a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Affiliation\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> Affiliation</a> *of the* <a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Legacy\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> ⏵Legacy</a> <a class=\"entity-link oracle-category-link\" data-dfid=\"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Identity\"><i class=\"fa fa-caret-right\"></i> ⏵Identity</a>","type":0,"drawn":false,"flags":{}}],"formula":"d100","replacement":true,"displayRoll":true,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UxRPXT7DZJSEuDW6":3},"flags":{"dfId":"Starforged/Oracles/Factions/Name_Template","category":"Starforged/Oracles/Factions"}}
